    "In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'(IMPLEMENTATION)'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section, and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully! \n",

    "> **Note**: Once you have completed all of the code implementations, you need to finalize your work by exporting the Jupyter Notebook as an HTML document. Before exporting the notebook to html, all of the code cells need to have been run so that reviewers can see the final implementation and output. You can then export the notebook by using the menu above and navigating to **File -> Download as -> HTML (.html)**. Include the finished document along with this notebook as your submission.\n",

    "In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.\n",

    "In this notebook, you will make the first steps towards developing an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app.  At the end of this project, your code will accept any user-supplied image as input.  If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed.  If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.  The image below displays potential sample output of your finished project (... but we expect that each student's algorithm will behave differently!). \n",

    "In this real-world setting, you will need to piece together a series of models to perform different tasks; for instance, the algorithm that detects humans in an image will be different from the CNN that infers dog breed.  There are many points of possible failure, and no perfect algorithm exists.  Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!\n",
