# Dog breeds detector app

This project is based on the [Deep Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) Course from Udacity.

## What is here?

A Flask application that receive an imput image from users and detect the following:

- If a dog is detected in the image, return the predicted breed.
- If a human is detected in the image, return the resembling dog breed.
- If neither is detected in the image, provide output that indicates an error.

In order to achieve that, I use CNNs, transfer learning, OpenCV, and some Deep Learning Techniques.
